# neural-network-challenge-2
mod 19
This project involves building a branched neural network to predict two things for employees:

Attrition: Whether an employee is likely to leave the company.
Department: The department that best fits the employee based on their characteristics.
The model was trained using employee data with features such as age, salary, years at the company, job satisfaction, and more. The network has two branches:

One for predicting Attrition (binary classification).
One for predicting Department (multi-class classification).
